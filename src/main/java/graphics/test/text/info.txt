What i want.

1. i want to register input from keyboard.

2. I want to filter that input. Through GLFW -> Bitmask to ignore values > 0x7F

3. Fields (editor/text fields etc.) that implement some keyInputListener interface

4. i want 7-bit us_ascii only, packing the chars to bytes and reducing texture allocation

    would also eliminate the need for key-value maps, instead using a static ascii byte[127]
    or smaller actually  32 -> 126 something like that. (cntr characters)

5. Loading fonts / creating fonts

6. Excluding glyphs outside the 7-bit space.

7. Keep everything as SIMPLE as possible, it's just letters on a screen

8. dynamic Editor with simple functionality including

    pointer movement, deleting, inserting

9. real time word wrapping, changing / resizing fonts etc.

10. sending the data to GPU

11. Pixel styled fonts is our main target -> minimal memory, perfect scaling.

    ..not really a need for kerning or typography deep dive

12. antialiasing, filtering for non-pixel style fonts
